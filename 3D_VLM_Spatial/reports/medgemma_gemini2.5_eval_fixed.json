    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "The ground truth states the changes are 'In the lung parenchyma adjacent to the nodule'. The nodule is specified as 'left lower lobe nodule'. The model's prediction that the changes are in the 'right lower lobe, adjacent to the left lower lobe nodule' is clinically contradictory, as 'adjacent' implies close proximity, which generally would not involve a different lung lobe unless specified as crossing the midline, which is not implied by 'adjacent'."

    "reasoning": "The ground truth 'Present in both lungs, millimetric in size' is semantically matched by the model's 'present in both lungs' and 'size range is approximately 3 to 6 mm'. '3-6 mm' is a specific instance of 'millimetric'."

    "prediction": "Based on the provided CT slices, the compression fracture appears to be located at the T12 vertebral level. The fracture is predominantly located in the superior endplate of the T12 vertebral body.
