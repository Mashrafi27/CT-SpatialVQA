    "answer": "In aortic valve localization.",
    "prediction": "Heart",

    "reasoning": "The prediction 'Heart' is too general; the ground truth specifies the precise anatomical location as 'aortic valve localization' which is critical for a valve replacement context."

    "answer": "In the apex of the left lung.",
    "prediction": "Multiple",

    "reasoning": "The prediction 'Multiple' describes the quantity of nodules, not their specific location within the left lung apex, which was the focus of the question and the ground truth."

    "reasoning": "The ground-truth answer describes the anatomical location where the adrenal glands are evaluated (upper abdomen), while the prediction describes their state ('unremarkable'). These are different clinical facts."

    "answer": "The thoracic aorta diameter is normal.",

    "reasoning": "The question asks if there are abnormalities. The ground-truth states the diameter is 'normal', which semantically means 'no abnormalities'. The prediction 'No' directly answers the question and conveys the same clinical fact."
