    "answer": "In the lung parenchyma adjacent to the nodule.",
    "prediction": "The parenchymal sequelae changes are located adjacent to the left lower lobe nodule. They are not directly related to the nodule itself but are observed in the same lung region. These changes may be due to previous lung disease or injury, which can lead to scarring and fibrosis. The nodule",

    "answer": "Present in both lungs, millimetric in size.",
    "prediction": "The pure calcified pulmonary nodules are present in both lungs, with the largest one measuring 6 mm in diameter. The nodules are described as pure calcified, meaning they are composed entirely of calcium deposits. The presence of these nodules in both lungs suggests a systemic condition, such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis",
    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The prediction correctly states 'present in both lungs' and provides a specific millimetric size ('6 mm') which falls within the general 'millimetric in size' range provided by the ground truth. The additional information does not contradict the core facts."

    "answer": "In both lungs.",

The changes are also noted in the right lung middle lobe medial segment and the left lung inferior lingular segment. The changes",

    "prediction": "The thyroid gland enlargement can be unilateral or bilateral. It is important to note that the thyroid gland can be affected by various conditions, including inflammation, infection, or tumors, which can lead to enlargement. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.<|end_of_text|>",
    "is_correct": false,

The fracture is described as having a height loss of 50% or more. The fracture is also described as having a lateral predominance, meaning that it is more severe in",
    "is_correct": false,
    "reasoning": "The prediction provides incorrect information for the vertebral level (T12 vs L1), the portion of the vertebral body (central part vs inferior endplate), and misses the specific side of the lateral predominance (left-sided). The clinical facts do not match."
