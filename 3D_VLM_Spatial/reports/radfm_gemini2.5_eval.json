    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The prediction 'sparing the left lung' is semantically equivalent to 'confined to the right lung' in the context of answering whether the nodules involve the left lung. Both convey that the left lung is not involved."

    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The prediction 'multilobar' directly answers the question about spanning multiple lobes.

    "reasoning": "The ground truth specifies the hernia was 'At the hiatus (hiatal hernia)'. A hiatal hernia is a specific type of diaphragmatic hernia involving the esophageal hiatus, typically not described as 'left'.

The ground truth states 'approximately 3 cm', which is the clinically accepted optimal range (typically 2-5 cm). The prediction states '1.2 cm', which is generally considered too close to the carina, increasing the risk of endobronchial intubation with head flexion.

The prediction, 'In the scanned vertebrae,' is more specific and thus narrower.

The prediction includes these ('mediastinal', 'right hilar', and 'left perihilar' which is equivalent to left hilar) but also adds 'right supraclavicular' and 'right axillary' regions.
