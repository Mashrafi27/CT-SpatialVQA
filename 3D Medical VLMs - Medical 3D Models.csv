DeepTumorVQA,https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18915,"1. Recognition Tasks (basic perception): Ensure the VLM can identify abnormalities and distinguish pathologies: Organ recognition , Lesion recognition, Lesion counting (number of lesions in an organ/segment), Lesion type classification, Fatty liver recognition

2. Measurement Tasks (quantitative analysis): Evaluate precision in numerical quantification, crucial for diagnosis and staging: Organ volume measurement, HU (Hounsfield Unit) value measurement, Lesion volume measurement, Volume comparison

3. Visual Reasoning Tasks (spatial/structural reasoning): Test models’ ability to reason about spatial context in 3D anatomy.: Adjacency reasoning, Inter-segment comparison, Lesion distribution analysis

4. Medical Reasoning Tasks (clinical decision-making):  Assess higher-level diagnostic reasoning aligned with radiology practice: Tumor staging, Resectability assessment, Diagnosis-level reasoning
