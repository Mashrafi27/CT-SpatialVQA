# E3D-GPT

- **GitHub**: _pending official release_
- **Paper**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14200
- **Primary Tasks**: report generation, interactive VQA, disease diagnosis from 3D scans.

## Action Items

- [ ] Locate release plans or reproduce via open-source analogs if unavailable.
- [ ] Outline prompt interface requirements once APIs/scripts exist.
- [ ] Align evaluation prompts with the interactive Q&A setting the paper highlights.

## Notes

Given its GPT-style interface, we may need to wrap a dialogue-style inference script that consumes multiple question turns per volume.
