## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor for GitHub release; log mirror or internal drop if provided privately.

- [ ] Prepare segmentation/VQA adapters so we can feed the shared question set.

## Notes

This model injects medical expert knowledge; if no code becomes available, note fallback baselines in this README.
