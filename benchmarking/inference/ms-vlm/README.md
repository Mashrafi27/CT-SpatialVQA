# MS-VLM

- **GitHub**: _not publicly released_
- **Paper**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13558
- **Primary Tasks**: radiology report generation across CT datasets; multi-plane/multi-phase reasoning.

## Action Items

- [ ] Identify or request source code / pretrained weights.
- [ ] Determine whether a third-party implementation exists that can approximate MS-VLM for benchmarking.
- [ ] Once code is available, follow the standard workflow (env setup, 10-sample run, requirements export).

## Notes

This model emphasizes multi-phase diagnostic reasoning rather than VQA. If no official release becomes available, consider documenting alternative baselines for similar tasks.
