DeepTumorVQA,https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18915,". Recognition Tasks (basic perception): Ensure the VLM can identify abnormalities and distinguish pathologies.

Organ recognition (e.g., detect presence of lesions or cysts)

Lesion recognition (is there a tumor/cyst in the organ?)

Lesion counting (number of lesions in an organ/segment)

Lesion type classification (cyst vs. tumor)

Fatty liver recognition (via HU ratio)


2. Measurement Tasks (quantitative analysis): Evaluate precision in numerical quantification, crucial for diagnosis and staging.

Organ volume measurement (e.g., left kidney volume)

HU (Hounsfield Unit) value measurement (mean HU in spleen, liver, etc.)

Lesion volume measurement (total lesion volume in liver, kidney, pancreas)

Volume comparison (e.g., which kidney is bigger?)


3. Visual Reasoning Tasks (spatial/structural reasoning): Test models’ ability to reason about spatial context in 3D anatomy.

Adjacency reasoning (which structure borders a lesion?)

Inter-segment comparison (distribution of lesions across liver segments)

Lesion distribution analysis (spatial lesion spread across anatomy)


4. Medical Reasoning Tasks (clinical decision-making):  Assess higher-level diagnostic reasoning aligned with radiology practice.

Tumor staging (T1–T4 staging for pancreatic tumors)

Resectability assessment (should the cyst/tumor be surgically resected?)

Diagnosis-level reasoning (e.g., cyst vs. tumor classification, fatty liver assessment)
